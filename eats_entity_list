Questions:
* What are the codes under #572 - English?  Language Type: Indo-European (572)
We've changed "English" to "Indo-European". I don't know why it's not revised in the <eatsml.xml> file.  Diane, I don't know which info you are working from or part of the file you are looking at so don't know what you mean by the codes "under" #572.

_Name Types_
* Alias #582
* Disambiguation #36556  Disambiguation: This name type is used only for working with the  EATS Oxygen plugin and is a (hopefully) temporary fix.  I don't think it's useful if you are not using the EATS Oxygen plugin.
* Plural #18609
* Primary #584
* Singular #18607
* Variant #586  Variant: We are thinking of deleting (VOIDing) this name type since we are not tracking variant spelling on REED Online. I've not deleted it yet because early on I used it and I have to find places where it's been used and revise the entity pages before I can VOID the name type. Just haven't got around to it yet.

* May be same entity as (#34835) Maybe be same entity as: This relationship is up for DAC discussion. It was originally created for cases where editors say things like "Smith [in the record] may be John Smith, who..." but having it is iffy and some of us are leaning towards deleting this option. Anyway, I'd advise not using it for now? 
* May be same entity as (reverse)
There is a relationship <is a/includes> (#22042) which exists right now but again was created earlier and was found too generic and haven't been used. I've not VOIDed it yet.  Likewise, currently, there's a relationship type <overlaps/overlaps> #23342 for geographic boundaries which is not used. It was originally intended for cases where area X overlaps (but is not fully contained within area Y). To date, we've decided to limit geographic relationships to the <contains/is contained within> relationship and go to the next smallest geographic area which fully contains area X rather than deal with overlaps. Easier to explain in real time if you wish.
