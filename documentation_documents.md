*Used James Cummings' taxonomy structure for Staffordshire*

Taxonomy structure:
# bibliography_sections
# record_types
# repositories - kept Staffordshire repositories with comment that they are not used for REED London/Inns of Court
# short_title_catalogues

Naming structure (which will be extended to all REED London refs):
# all xml:ids begin with #RL (expample: RLGIPB1 is REED London Gray's Inn Pension Book 1). I believe this is in keeping with the nomenclature used for Staffordshire and other eREED collections.

At this point I think it makes sense to expand the repository listing to include the other London-centric collections, at least for the printed volumes.

Because this file is an approximation of the work presented in the printed version of *Inns of Court* I've created an "Introduction" section before the "Sources" section. I find this contextual information to helpful - in terms of keeping track of Alan H. Nelson's process of using sources.

The Appendices (Vol. 3) also have a list of Sources, and one question we should ask is whether those sources should be folded into the record source section or not. It might make sense to do so with a reference (perhaps in "edDesc"?) to the fact that they come from the Appendix.
