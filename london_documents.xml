                  <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
                     establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
                     contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
                     and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
                     communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
                     closed the London theatres.</p>

               <head>Introduction to Documents</head>
            
               <p>Documents described below are grouped first under the four Inns of Court in alphabetical order, then under a single Inn of Chancery (Furnival’s). Documents not assignable to a particular Inn follow, grouped as Letters (diplomatic and private), Diaries and Reminiscences, Histories, and Miscellaneous. Individual items within the latter categories are listed in chronological order.</p>
               
               <div n="Inns of Court">
                  <head>Inns of Court</head>
                  
                  <div n="Gray's Inn">
                     <head>Gray's Inn</head>
                     <p>The history of Gray’s Inn as a site of legal activity may be traced back before 1370. The Inn occupied property owned or controlled by the dean and chapter of St Paul’s, and subsequently by the family of Grey of Wilton. Historically the manor was called Portpoole, remembered today in Portpool Street which runs eastward from Gray’s Inn Road. (In Elizabethan and Stuart times the site gave its name to the Inn’s lord of Christmas, called the Prince of Portpool or Purpoole.)</p>
                        <p>The northernmost of the four Inns of Court, Gray’s Inn, is bounded on the east by Gray’s Inn Lane (now Gray’s Inn Road), on the south by shops fronting on High Holborn, on the west by Bedford Mews (now Jockey’s Fields), and on the north by the King’s Way (now Theobalds Road) and fields not yet built over. Within its walls Gray’s Inn comprises law chambers (still used for residence), a hall, a chapel, a library, a treasury, and walks and gardens. Today’s Gray’s Inn is mostly post-Restoration in its architecture, though it preserves the original layout of its buildings and grounds.</p>
                        <p>The governing body of Gray’s Inn is called the <orgName>pension</orgName>. Orders of pension were recorded in a series of Pension Books. Archival documents, maintained under the care of an archivist, are produced and read in the library.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div n="Inner Temple">
                     <head>Inner Temple</head>
                     <p>Seat of the Knights Templar prior to the suppression of the order in 1312, the ‘Temple’ lay just beyond the western reach of London Wall, between Fleet Street and the Thames. As early as the reign of Edward III (1312–77) the Temple accommodated both the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem and legal professionals, the latter enjoying easy access to the royal courts of Westminster. The Paston letters of November 1440 contain the earliest known reference to the Inner Temple, also called a ‘college’; subsequent letters in the same series identify the Middle Temple in similar terms. Though the site was and remains a walled (or fenced) and gated enclosure, the internal boundary between the two inns is not a wall but a lane. Symbolic of the traditionally peaceful coexistence of the two Inns is the Temple Church, shared and governed by both.</p>
                        <p>The Inner Temple occupies the eastern (down-river) half of the Temple grounds. Further to the east is the site of the Whitefriars’ monastery, historically a ‘liberty.’ Entrances to the Inner Temple include one or more gates to the north along Fleet Street and a water-gate leading to the Thames (now to the Embankment).
                        Physically the Inner Temple comprised law chambers, which traditionally doubled as residential facilities, a hall, the Temple Church, a library, gardens, and a treasury. Alone among the four Inns the Inner Temple lacks its early-modern hall, demolished in 1866 (see p xlii). The Inner Temple retains an old-world atmosphere, a consequence of careful reconstruction following extensive devastation in World War II.</p>
                        <p>The governing body of the Inner Temple, called the parliament, consisted of all members holding the rank of master of the bench (or ‘bencher’). Parliament was convened in the hall (‘at the bench,’ that is, the benchers’ or high table) at two- or three-week intervals throughout the year. The orders of this body, called acts of parliament, were for the most part entered into a series of Parliament Books. By tradition the benchers governed only during term, while the masters of the bar (‘barristers’) governed during vacations, and junior members governed during Christmas vacation.</p>
                        <p>All Inner Temple administrative records earlier than 1505 and all financial records earlier than 1606 are wanting. At the close of World War II, when the surviving archives were being returned after having been removed for safe-keeping, certain documents were damaged by fire in a road accident. Had they not been removed, however, they would not have survived at all, as the Inner Temple was almost completely destroyed by enemy bombing, including all of the library’s records and all its modern printed books.</p>
                     <p>Archives of the Inner Temple are in the custody of the sub-treasurer. Prior to 1989 they were maintained in a strong room in the treasurer’s office. In 1990 the historical archives were moved to a new purpose-built room, where they are supervised by the master of the archives.</p>

                  <div n="Middle Temple">
                     <head>Middle Temple</head>
                     <p>The early history of the Middle Temple is much the same as that of the Inner Temple. It occupies the western (or up-river) half of the Temple grounds. Entrance gates have historically included one or more gates to the north along Fleet Street, one to the west, and a water-gate to the Thames, now the north side of the Embankment.</p>
                        <p>Physically the Middle Temple comprises law chambers, which traditionally doubled as residential facilities, an exceptionally large and magnificent hall, a chapel, a library, gardens, and a treasury. Architecturally the Middle Temple retains an old-world atmosphere, to some extent a consequence of careful reconstruction following World War II.</p>
                        <p>The governing body of the Middle Temple is called the parliament; its orders, called minutes of parliament, are preserved in volumes called Parliament Books. Middle Temple Parliament Books survive from 1500, except that the second volume, for 1524–51, is lost (whence number ‘2’ is omitted from the sequence of shelfmarks).</p>
                        <p>Financial documents surviving from our period include treasurers’ Receipt Books from a series which is complete only from 1637–8 to 1641–6, while a single book survives from earlier years, for 1614–15. The years just prior to 1642 are also represented by treasurers’ Disbursement Books for 1640–1 and 1641–2. A unique series of unbound scraps mostly associated with Inns of Court masques survives abundantly from 1612–13 and 1633–4, and occasionally for other years.</p>
                        <p>The standard essential publications are Charles Henry Hopwood (ed), <hi rend="italic">Middle Temple Records</hi>, 3 vols and index (London, 1904–5); and <hi rend="italic">A Calendar of the Middle Temple Records</hi> (London, 1903).</p>
                     
                     <div n="Middle Temple Loose Papers">
                        <head>Middle Temple Loose Papers</head>
                        <p>When research for this collection began, the following loose papers, including many signed receipts still folded into little bundles, were maintained in archival boxes labelled, for example, ‘Papers and Accounts Concerning Masques.’ Recently the scraps have been unfolded and preserved in mylar sleeves gathered into ring binders. Most have been described and published by Orbison in ‘Traces of Two Jacobean Dramatic Performances at the Middle Temple,’ pp 55–62; ‘Research Opportunities at the Inns of Court,’ pp 27–33; and the Malone Society’s <hi rend="italic">Collections</hi> 12. A more recent publication is Elliott, ‘Musical and Dramatic Documents from the Middle Temple,’ pp 171–93.</p>
                           <p>Various numbers have been assigned to these documents at various times, including numbers assigned or recorded by Orbison and Elliott. New numbers, assigned by the Middle Temple archivist in the course of recent organization and conservation, are followed here; previously assigned numbers are also recorded.</p>
                           <p>We list the papers here, under four categories (GDE, MAA, MAB, TUT), in archive order. As all items are paper, and all are in English, those details are not individually noted. Single sheets are typically written on one side only, except for endorsements. Exceptions and bifolia are described in greater detail.</p>

                     <p>An Inn of Chancery, Furnival’s Inn was apparently founded late in the fourteenth century and was purchased by Lincoln’s Inn in 1547. Situated between Portpool Street (later Gray’s Inn Road) on the west and Ely House (later Hatton Gardens) on the east, its imposing facade loomed over High Holborn. Having survived the Great Fire of London (1666), the Inn was dissolved in 1817 and replaced in 1897 by the Royal Assurance Society, whose building still stands.</p>

Henry Chandos-Pole (1829–1902), second son of Edward Sacheverell Chandos-Pole, inherited Hopton Hall and estate from Philip Gell, formally taking the name Gell in 1865. The papers are now allocated permanently to the Derbyshire Record Office. Searches for the third document in the Derbyshire Record Office in 1988 and again in 1991 were unsuccessful.</ab>
